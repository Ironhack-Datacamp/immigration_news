## Project_Description

I wanted to investigate if there is a correlation between the frequency of news articles on immigration and number of immigrants, using Australia as a case study. 

I was able to locate a dataset on Kaggle containing over 1 million news headings and their dates from the main Australian public broadcaster, ABC news. I located Australian government datasets with numbers of migrants by country of origin and migration category. 


## Questions_&_Hypotheses

A few key questions guided my analysis:

1. How many people immigrate to Australia and what are the most common origin countries?
2. How often does migration feature in the news?
3. Is there a correlation between media coverage on migration and actual immigration numbers?

I suspected that both news and immigration had increased in recent years, and hypothesized that there would be a correlation between media coverage on migration and immigration numbers. 


Policies and controversial events have a stronger influence on amount of news coverage than actual migration numbers. 

## Datasets
I utilised two separate databanks for my analysis.

1. ‘A Million News Headlines’
ABC news headlines for years 2003 to 2019
1 csv file

2. ‘Historical Migration Statistics’

## Resources

As NLP was not covered in the Ironhack bootcamp, I relied on free online resources to learn the basics. I found [this video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvqsFTUsOmc&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=PyOhio) and corresponding [Github repo](https://github.com/adashofdata/nlp-in-python-tutorial/blob/master/1-Data-Cleaning.ipynb) particularly helpful in getting started with NLP. 

## Workflow
